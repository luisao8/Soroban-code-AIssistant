human_transcribed_response = """Smart Contract to build: Crowdfunding Campaign 

Details:
What is the funding goal and deadline for the campaign?

The funding goal is 50,000 XLM.
The deadline for the campaign is set for 60 days from the launch date.
Who is the recipient of the funds if the goal is met?

The recipient of the funds is the "Green City Park Initiative," a registered non-profit organization managing the community park project.
Contribution Handling:
How should contributions be tracked and recorded?

Contributions should be tracked by recording each contributor's address and the amount contributed in a ledger within the smart contract.
Each contribution will be logged as a transaction event, which includes the contributor's address, the contribution amount, and the timestamp.
Are there limits on the amount or frequency of contributions?

The minimum contribution amount is 100 XLM.
There is no maximum limit on contributions.
Contributors can make multiple contributions without any restrictions on frequency.
Finalization Conditions:
What are the conditions for finalizing the campaign and disbursing funds?

The campaign will be finalized if the deadline is reached.
If the total contributions meet or exceed the funding goal of 50,000 XLM by the deadline, the funds will be automatically disbursed to the "Green City Park Initiative" account.
What happens if the funding goal is not met?

If the funding goal is not met by the deadline, the campaign will be marked as unsuccessful.
In this case, contributors will be eligible to reclaim their funds.
Refund Mechanism:
How should refunds be handled if the campaign does not reach its goal?

Refunds should be handled by allowing contributors to withdraw their contributions from the smart contract.
Each contributor's address and contribution amount will be stored, enabling them to reclaim their exact contribution.
What are the conditions and process for contributors to reclaim their funds?

If the funding goal is not met by the deadline, contributors can reclaim their funds.
The process involves calling a refund function in the smart contract, which verifies the contributor's address and returns the contributed amount.
Contributors can claim their refunds within a 30-day period following the campaign's end"""

        pub fn is_user_registered(env: Env, user: Address) -> bool {
            // Checking user registration status
            // Efficient query implementation
        }
    }
    Phase 3: Oracle Integration
    Ensure the correct and efficient use of oracles within the smart contract. Confirm best practices for invoking oracles and handling oracle data securely.
    
    Example Oracle Integration:
    
    rust
    Copiar código
    use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, Env, Address};
    
    pub struct OracleIntegration;
    
    #[contractimpl]
    impl OracleIntegration {
        pub fn fetch_data_from_oracle(env: Env, oracle_address: Address) -> i64 {
            // Secure and efficient oracle data fetching
            // Best practices for handling oracle data
        }
    }
    Phase 4: Horizon API/RPC and External Providers
    Optimize the use of Horizon API/RPC and external providers to ensure best practices are followed for querying the Stellar network and submitting transactions.
    
    Example RPC Integration:
    
    rust
    Copiar código
    use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, Env, Address};
    
    pub struct RPCIntegration;
    
    #[contractimpl]
    impl RPCIntegration {
        pub fn query_data(env: Env, endpoint: &str) -> i64 {
            // Optimal use of Horizon API/RPC
            // Best practices for querying data
        }
    
        pub fn submit_transaction(env: Env, tx: &str) -> bool {
            // Best practices for transaction submission
            // Secure and efficient transaction handling
        }
    }
    Phase 5: Final Review and Output
    Perform a final review, compile feedback, and output the final .rs files in text format.

Problem Statement:

Smart Contract to build: Crowdfunding Campaign
Details:
Funding Goal: 50,000 XLM
Deadline: 60 days from the launch date
Recipient of Funds: "Green City Park Initiative," a registered non-profit organization managing the community park project.
Contribution Handling:
Contributions should be tracked by recording each contributor's address and the amount contributed in a ledger within the smart contract.
Each contribution will be logged as a transaction event, including the contributor's address, contribution amount, and timestamp.
Minimum contribution amount: 10 XLM, no maximum limit, and multiple contributions allowed.
Finalization Conditions:
The campaign will be finalized if the deadline is reached.
If total contributions meet or exceed 50,000 XLM by the deadline, funds will be automatically disbursed to the "Green City Park Initiative" account.
If the funding goal is not met, contributors can reclaim their funds.
Refund Mechanism:
Contributors can reclaim their funds if the goal is not met.
The process involves calling a refund function in the smart contract, which verifies the contributor's address and returns the contributed amount.
Refunds can be claimed within 30 days following the campaign's end.
Final Design and Files:

audit_log.rs
Manages event logging (contributions, refunds, disbursements).
contribution.rs
Handles contribution logic and storage.
disbursement.rs
Manages disbursement of funds if the campaign is successful.
finalization.rs
Finalizes the campaign based on the deadline and funding goal.
refund.rs
Handles refunds for contributors if the campaign is unsuccessful.
security.rs
Ensures the contract's security.
lib.rs
Main module file that imports and re-exports all modules.

ask is to create comprehensive documentation in markdown (.md) format for a Soroban-based smart contract project your team has been tasked with. This is the final step in the 
development process, aimed at helping other developers understand, use, and maintain the smart contract. You will receive a problem statement, final design details, 
and the complete Rust code for each module that your team has already generated. Your documentation should explain the contract thoroughly, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for developers 
at various levels of expertise.

Instructions
Understand the Problem Statement and Final Design:

Carefully review the provided problem statement and final design details to understand the context and purpose of the smart contract.
Review the Complete Code:

Examine the complete Rust code for each module to understand their functionalities, interdependencies, and how they collectively achieve the smart contract's goals.
Generate Comprehensive Documentation:

Create a markdown (.md) file that includes the following sections:
Introduction: Briefly describe the smart contract, its purpose, and the problem it solves.
Overview: Provide an overview of the contract's architecture, including the main modules and their interactions.
Modules and Functions: Detailed documentation for each module and its functions, including:
Function signatures
Purpose and functionality
Parameters and return values
Examples of usage
Deployment and Usage: Instructions on how to compile, deploy, and interact with the smart contract.
Testing: Guidelines on how to test the smart contract, including any test cases or scenarios.
Security Considerations: Highlight any security measures implemented and best practices for secure usage.
FAQ: Address common questions and troubleshooting tips.
Ensure Accuracy and Clarity:

Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to cross-check the latest best practices and ensure the documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to follow. 

IMPORTANT: ONLY OUTPUT THE TEXT OF THE MD FILE. """
